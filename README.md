GlossaryBot, developed using JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and Bolt, is a Slack application designed to aid workspaces with confusing acronyms and terminology.

 **DESCRIPTION:**

GlossaryBot can be accessed via 5 different slash commands: `/gb-help`, `/gb-list`, `/gb-define [word]`, `/gb-add`, `/gb-remove [word]`.

> `/gb-help` returns a welcoming message with a list of all available slash commands

> `/gb-list` returns a list of all words in the glossary (sorted alphabetically)

> `/gb-define [word]` defines a word within the glossary; if the word doesn't exist, user is prompted to add their word to the glossary 

> `/gb-add` prompts a modal for the user to enter and define their word; if the word already exists, the user is prompted to search the definition
